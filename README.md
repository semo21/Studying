# Studying

This repo is for my study history.

And when i program C with my Visual Studio 2022, current version doesn't accept using `scanf` function. So i've been using `scanf_s` function for instead.

031824 HellDiver 2 is really awesome! It's super fun and are many good players.
Also Baldur's Gate's genre has been always not for me, but BG3 is one of the best game. The Camera move, Characters appearance, game systems and of course it's fun, but most of all, it's narration and story telling is the best. Like i'm really the one of them. :D. maybe i'll continue my study since tomorrow lol.
